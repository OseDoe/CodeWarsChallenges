# Collection of Code Wars Challenges

All challenges should be mainly solved using JavaScript (ES6)
Some of them may be tried in Java as well.

- STRUCTURE:

The readme.txt inside each directory should display the problem.
The file app.js will have the code with the answer and a simple call with some basic parameters.
A second file named app2.js can be included with alternative solutions.

- NOTE 1:

Since this directory wasn't intended to be uploaded on GitHub, and just as a way to code more comfortably the problems. There's a a few challenges that lack of the said readme with the problem, although the name of the function should be clear enough to understand what is asking.

- NOTE 2:

Tests cases are included at the end of the file, in the following form:

```javascript
describe("Example Tests", function() {
    it("Example Test Case", function() {
      Test.assertEquals(add(1, 1), 2, "optional message");
    });
});
```
